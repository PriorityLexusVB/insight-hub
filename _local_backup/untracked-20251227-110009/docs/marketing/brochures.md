### Merged summary
The conversation revolves around designing the outside spread of a tri-fold brochure for Priority Lexus Virginia Beach, specifically focusing on a Pre-Owned Vehicle Maintenance Guide. The design must align with the premium Lexus style, including color palette, typography, and layout. The brochure will feature three panels: the back panel for contact information, a flap panel highlighting service capabilities for all makes and models, and a front cover that introduces the maintenance guide. The design emphasizes clarity, brand consistency, and the removal of any references to collision services. The design specifications include a landscape format, a Lexus-inspired premium style, and a structured layout with three equal columns. Each panel is dedicated to specific content: the left panel welcomes customers and outlines service conveniences, the center panel details maintenance roadmaps…
