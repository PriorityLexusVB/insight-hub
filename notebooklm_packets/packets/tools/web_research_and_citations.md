# Web Research + Citations

Use when you need up-to-date facts or anything that may have changed.

Rules:
- Prefer primary sources (official docs, vendor docs, filings).
- Always capture citations with URL + date.
- When “latest” is implied, confirm publication date.
- Use image search for people/places/things when visuals help.

Outputs:
- Verified facts + citations
- What changed / why it matters
- Next actions
