# NotebookLM Runbook (GitHub Bundle Workflow)

**Goal:** Use NotebookLM from **public GitHub URLs** (no local uploads), driven by **actual analytics output** (not memory/guessing), with a repeatable “refresh loop”.

This repo already generates `analytics/_current/chat_index.json`. We convert that into:

- **tool packet files** (`notebooklm_packets/…`)
- an **upload plan** (`NOTEBOOKLM_UPLOAD_PLAN.md`)
- **bundle sources** committed to GitHub (`notebooklm_bundles/*.md`)
- NotebookLM sources are then **URLs** to the bundles.

## Source of truth

### Analytics

- `analytics/_current/chat_index.json` (generated by indexer CLI analyze)
- `analytics/_current/data_dictionary.md`
- `analytics/_current/work_summary.md`
- dashboard output: `analytics/_current/index.html`

### NotebookLM artifacts

Generated (do not commit):

- `notebooklm_packets/`
- `notebooklm_upload/`
- `NOTEBOOKLM_UPLOAD_PLAN.md`

Committed (GitHub-first):

- `notebooklm_bundles/` (these are the NotebookLM URL sources)
- `scripts/notebooklm_*` generators

Optional temporary sources (for triage context):

- `analytics/_current/triage/` (triage batches and reports)
- See [RUNBOOK_TRIAGE.md](./RUNBOOK_TRIAGE.md) for triage workflow

## NotebookLM structure (recommended)

Use **3 notebooks** in NotebookLM. Minimal, organized, fast:

### Notebook 1 — Insight Hub Core

Sources (URLs):

- `notebooklm_bundles/notebooklm_index_tables.md`
- `notebooklm_bundles/insight_hub_repo_packets.md`

### Notebook 2 — Tools Top Ranked

Sources (URL):

- `notebooklm_bundles/tools_top_ranked.md`

### Notebook 3 — Tools Extended

Sources (URLs):

- `notebooklm_bundles/tools_engineering_data.md`
- `notebooklm_bundles/tools_office_outputs.md`
- `notebooklm_bundles/tools_integrations.md`

---

## Add sources in NotebookLM (GitHub URLs)

Preferred (raw):

- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/<BRANCH>/notebooklm_bundles/<FILE>.md`

Fallbacks if raw is blocked:

- `https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/raw/<BRANCH>/notebooklm_bundles/<FILE>.md`
- `https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/blob/<BRANCH>/notebooklm_bundles/<FILE>.md?raw=1`

---

## Refresh loop (what to run when you want NotebookLM updated)

### Step A — Regenerate analytics

From repo root:

```bash
pnpm -C apps/indexer-cli start -- analyze --out analytics/_current --emit-rollup --emit-html
```
